## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

   - Check the `users` table in Supabase to verify the user's email

   - Check the Row Level Security policies in Supabase

## Best Practices

1. **Verify User Information**
   - Always double-check the user's email before adding an account
   - Ensure the MT5 account details are accurate

2. **Document Account Changes**
   - Keep a record of accounts you add or delete
   - Communicate with users when making changes to their accounts

3. **Regular Audits**
   - Periodically review the accounts in the system
   - Remove unused or inactive accounts

## Security Considerations

1. **Admin Access Control**
   - Limit the number of admin accounts
   - Use strong passwords for admin accounts
   - Consider implementing two-factor authentication

2. **Data Privacy**
   - Only access user account information when necessary
   - Respect user privacy and data protection regulations

3. **Audit Logging**
   - All admin actions are logged
   - These logs can be reviewed in case of security incidents
